# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a React TypeScript application bootstrapped with Create React App. The project follows standard CRA conventions and structure.

## Development Commands

- `npm start` - Start development server (opens http://localhost:3000)
- `npm test` - Run tests in interactive watch mode
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run eject` - Remove CRA abstraction (one-way operation)

## Architecture

- **Frontend Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Create React App (react-scripts 5.0.1)
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Entry Point**: src/index.tsx
- **Main Component**: src/App.tsx

## Key Files

- `src/App.tsx` - Main application component
- `src/index.tsx` - Application entry point
- `public/index.html` - HTML template
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

## Testing

Tests use Jest and React Testing Library. Test files should follow the pattern `*.test.tsx` or be placed in `__tests__` directories.


# Claude Project Prompt â€” Studio Pickens Website

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
You are an expert frontend developer helping me build a production-ready website for a high-end creative studio. The design is premium, interactive, and rooted in subtle transitions and aesthetic typography.

Build this project using **React and Tailwind CSS**. All code must be written in JSX with Tailwind classes. The tone is clean, efficient, and focused on polish and responsiveness.

## ðŸŽ¯ Site Overview
Build a responsive, scroll-animated website for **Studio Pickens**.

Pages:
- Home (Hero, Polaroids, Scroll Interactions)
- Work
- Process
- Story
- Locations
- Contact
- FAQ

## ðŸ§  Design System

**Typography**
- Font: Proxima Nova Extra Wide
- Weight: 700
- Size: 14px
- Letter Spacing: 3%
- Transform: UPPERCASE

**Spacing**
- 8pt spacing system (4px, 8px, 16px, 32px, etc.)

**Colors**
- Background: `#F8F7F7`
- Primary Text: `#0025B8`
- Underline: `linear-gradient(0deg, #FF7E46, #FF7E46)`
- Link Hover: Blue text + orange underline

**Micro-Interactions**
- Scroll-based layout transitions
- Subtle sine-based floating
- Hover and active feedback for all interactive elements

---

## ðŸ§© Navbar Behavior

1. Navbar has 3 links on the left (WORK, PROCESS, STORY) and 3 on the right (LOCATIONS, CONTACT, FAQ).
2. These links are evenly spaced on initial render.
3. On scroll, the site title "STUDIO PICKENS" animates from below (inside hero) to the center of the navbar.
4. The two link groups slide left/right to make space for the centered title.
5. Underline animation on hover/active should use orange linear-gradient.
6. Responsive: flex-col for mobile, flex-row for desktop (`md:flex-row`), with touch targets at least 44px.

## âœ… Output Format Instructions

When responding:
- Write full JSX + Tailwind CSS code blocks
- Include transition logic using Tailwind utilities or minimal JS
- Return one file/component per section unless instructed otherwise
- Provide comments only where logic is non-obvious
- Avoid unnecessary boilerplate
